# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Offline-First Triage System is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help medical personnel in crisis zones efficiently triage patients when internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable. The system enables healthcare workers to quickly assess and categorize patients based on their symptoms and conditions, maintain a prioritized patient queue, and export data for sharing with other medical teams. The application must function completely offline while providing the ability to sync data when connectivity is restored.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical professional in a crisis zone, I want to quickly input patient information using minimal typing, so that I can efficiently process patients even under high-stress conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the patient input form THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown menus and checkboxes for common symptoms
2. WHEN a user enters patient information THEN the system SHALL require only essential fields (name, age, symptoms, condition)
3. WHEN a user selects symptoms THEN the system SHALL allow multiple symptom selection via checkboxes
4. WHEN a user submits patient information THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before saving
5. WHEN a user completes the form THEN the system SHALL clear all fields for the next patient entry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the system to automatically assign triage levels based on patient symptoms, so that I can quickly identify the most critical cases without manual assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient has critical symptoms (bleeding heavily, unconscious, fainting, severe pain) THEN the system SHALL assign "Critical" triage level
2. WHEN a patient has urgent symptoms (fever, vomiting, moderate pain) THEN the system SHALL assign "Urgent" triage level
3. WHEN a patient has stable symptoms or no critical/urgent indicators THEN the system SHALL assign "Stable" triage level
4. WHEN triage level is assigned THEN the system SHALL store this classification with the patient record
5. WHEN condition notes contain keywords like "critical" or "urgent" THEN the system SHALL factor these into triage level assignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to view a color-coded patient queue ordered by priority, so that I can immediately identify which patients need attention first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all patients in a prioritized queue
2. WHEN displaying patients THEN the system SHALL use red color coding for Critical patients
3. WHEN displaying patients THEN the system SHALL use yellow color coding for Urgent patients
4. WHEN displaying patients THEN the system SHALL use green color coding for Stable patients
5. WHEN new patients are added THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the queue display
6. WHEN displaying patient cards THEN the system SHALL show name, age, symptoms, condition, and triage level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to export patient data as CSV files, so that I can share information with other medical teams or facilities when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the export button THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with all patient data
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include patient ID, name, age, symptoms, condition, triage level, and timestamp
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL format the filename with current date and time
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically download the file to the user's device
5. WHEN multiple symptoms exist THEN the system SHALL separate them with semicolons in the CSV

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a medical professional working in areas with unreliable internet, I want the application to work completely offline, so that I can continue triaging patients regardless of connectivity status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL function without internet connectivity
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL store all patient data locally using IndexedDB
3. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL allow full patient input, triage assignment, and queue viewing
4. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL cache all application resources for offline access
5. WHEN connectivity status changes THEN the system SHALL display current online/offline status
6. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL maintain all functionality including data export

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to install the application on my device like a native app, so that I can access it quickly without opening a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL be installable as a PWA
2. WHEN installed THEN the system SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
3. WHEN installed THEN the system SHALL display appropriate app icons and branding
4. WHEN launched THEN the system SHALL load quickly from cached resources
5. WHEN offline THEN the installed app SHALL function identically to the web version

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a medical professional using basic devices, I want the application to perform well on low-specification hardware, so that I can use it effectively regardless of device limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on low-spec devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI performance
2. WHEN loading THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle size and resource usage
3. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback without lag
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL save patient information quickly without blocking the UI
5. WHEN displaying the queue THEN the system SHALL render patient cards efficiently even with many entries

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want clear visual indicators and accessible interface elements, so that I can use the system effectively in high-stress emergency situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing interface elements THEN the system SHALL use high-contrast colors for readability
2. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide buttons with minimum 44x44px touch targets
3. WHEN using form controls THEN the system SHALL include clear labels and ARIA attributes for accessibility
4. WHEN viewing triage levels THEN the system SHALL use distinct, easily recognizable color coding
5. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use legible font sizes appropriate for emergency use
