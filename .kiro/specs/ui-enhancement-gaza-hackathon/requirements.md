#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing patient cards THEN the system SHALL display clear visual indicators for triage priority levels
2. WHEN browsing the patient list THEN the system SHALL provide improved spacing, typography, and visual organization
3. WHEN using the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show enhanced layout with better information hierarchy
4. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL provide improved input styling and validation feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application on different devices, I want responsive design improvements, so that the interface works effectively on mobile devices commonly used in field medical situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display properly scaled and touch-friendly interfaces
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the system SHALL optimize layout for medical workflow efficiency
3. WHEN using different screen orientations THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and visual appeal
4. WHEN interacting with touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate button sizes and spacing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a medical professional in Gaza, I want patient forms that mirror the standardized hospital forms used locally, so that I can efficiently collect the same information that would be recorded on paper forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new patient record THEN the system SHALL include sections for personal details, main complaint, history, examination findings, provisional diagnosis, and treatment plan
2. WHEN filling out patient forms THEN the system SHALL organize information in sections that match Gaza hospital emergency department sheets
3. WHEN viewing patient information THEN the system SHALL display data in a format familiar to Gaza medical staff
4. WHEN completing patient intake THEN the system SHALL capture all essential information typically recorded on standardized Gaza hospital forms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a medical professional during shift changes, I want a handover notes feature, so that I can efficiently communicate patient status and updates to incoming staff without relying solely on oral briefings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing a shift THEN the system SHALL allow creation of handover summary notes for each patient
2. WHEN starting a shift THEN the system SHALL display recent handover notes and patient updates
3. WHEN updating patient status THEN the system SHALL automatically track key changes for handover purposes
